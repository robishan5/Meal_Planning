The app helps create ideas for planning meals by randomly selecting recipes from a predefined list.

You'll need to create that list of recipes, which for this version is simply a text file with each recipe name on
a new line.

When run, the app will print a list of 5 randomly selected recipes, and then ask the user to select one by entering
a number corresponding to it.

When the user is done selecting random recipes, they can quit the program by entering q or quit.

Then the app will print the selected recipes, before quitting.
